# model/espnet/decoder

## Purpose of the Folder

The `model/espnet/decoder/` directory contains transformer-based decoder implementations for the Arabic lip reading system. This folder is responsible for:

- **Sequence Decoding**: Converting encoded visual features into target text sequences
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Implementing self-attention and cross-attention for sequence modeling
- **Autoregressive Generation**: Supporting autoregressive text generation during inference
- **Batch Scoring**: Providing efficient batch processing for beam search integration
