# model/espnet/scorers

## Purpose of the Folder

The `model/espnet/scorers/` directory contains scoring mechanisms for beam search decoding in the Arabic lip reading system. This folder is responsible for:

- **Beam Search Scoring**: Providing various scoring mechanisms for hypothesis ranking
- **CTC Integration**: Implementing CTC prefix scoring for hybrid CTC/Attention models
- **Length Normalization**: Offering length bonus scoring for sequence length control
- **Modular Scoring**: Supporting multiple scorer combinations with configurable weights
